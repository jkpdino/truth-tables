# Truth Tables

Truth tables is a rust command line tool which takes in a boolean expression, and outputs a truth table for it. Truth tables supports:

- [x] T and F for true and false
- [x] Equality and inequality
- [x] Parenthesized expressions
- [x] And, Or, and Not expressions
- [x] The -> implies operator
- [x] The <-> if and only if operator
- [x] Lowercase variables
- [x] Pretty-prints a truth table for every possibility of the input variables

## Running truth tables

With rust intalled, open a terminal in the repo and run:

```
cargo run
```

Enter a proposition, and then press enter to see the truth table. Press CTRL+C to quit.
